Personal Site Design

What is you site's primary purpose?

I see my site as a portfolio to an extent. At the moment, I want it to show what I'm learning in my current studies, and for it to be an informative blog but also easy to navigate.

Who is your target audience?

My target audience would be possible future employers. At the same time, I want everyone who uses the internet to be able to navigate the website intuitively. I also think that people who are interested in technology and design from a wide variety of disicplines would see that my personal site is accessible.  

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want them to enjoy the minimalistic space without feeling empty. I also want the site to be practical and usable. I'd like to, in the future, have playable games on the blog. I have some experience with programming games and I'd like to make simple playable games on the blog, but that is to be seen in the future.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I've been using Bootstrap so far, and I think I can build a responsive website using Bootstrap. I also will do some research into web designs, and borrow some ideas to create a sketch of the website build. Then I'll code the divisions using what I learned in HTML, code a style section for simple customization without altering the CSS Bootstrap file, and then check my progress.
